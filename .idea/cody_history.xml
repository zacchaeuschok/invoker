It consists of multiple containers working together:&#10;&#10;1. The main container, which runs the core task execution logic.&#10;2.

                      <text value="Certainly! When you send a Kafka message, assuming everything is running based on the configurations in sample.yaml, the typical data flow looks like this:&#10;&#10;1. You send a message to the input Kafka topic (default is &quot;test&quot;).&#10;&#10;2. The KafkaIOManager in the input sidecar container of the executor pod consumes this message. It's configured to connect to the Kafka broker specified in the environment variables.&#10;&#10;3. The KafkaIOManager's pollRequests method is called periodically by the TaskCore in the main container. This fetches the consumed messages from Kafka.&#10;&#10;4. The TaskCore's pollPhase method receives these messages as KeyValuePair objects and adds them to the taskExecutor for processing.&#10;&#10;5. The taskExecutor in the main container processes these messages according to the implemented business logic.&#10;&#10;6. If the processing results in output, it would be sent to the output sidecar.&#10;&#10;7. The output sidecar, also using a KafkaIOManager, would then produce these messages to the output Kafka topic (default is &quot;output&quot;).&#10;&#10;8. You can then consume these processed messages from the output topic using a Kafka consumer.&#10;&#10;This flow allows for decoupled, scalable processing of Kafka messages within the Kubernetes environment, with the sidecars handling the Kafka I/O operations and the main container focusing on the core processing logic." />

Kubernetes-native: It's designed from the ground up to run in Kubernetes, leveraging its orchestration capabilities for scalability and resilience.&#10;&#10;2. Sidecar architecture: The use of input and output sidecars for I/O operations allows for a clean separation of concerns, making the main processing logic more focused and maintainable.&#10;&#10;3. Flexibility: The system can easily adapt to different processing needs by modifying the main container's logic, while keeping the I/O infrastructure consistent.&#10;&#10;4. Kafka integration: Deep integration with Kafka allows for efficient stream processing and exactly-once semantics.&#10;&#10;5. ConfigMap-based configuration: Utilizing Kubernetes ConfigMaps for configuration management enhances deployability and runtime reconfiguration.&#10;&#10;6. Custom state management: The implementation of a custom state manager allows for fine-grained control over state handling.&#10;&#10;Compared to Flink, this project offers:&#10;&#10;1. Lighter weight: It's potentially less resource-intensive for simpler use cases.&#10;2. Easier customization: The modular design makes it straightforward to modify or extend functionality.&#10;3. Tighter Kubernetes integration: Being built specifically for Kubernetes, it can leverage its features more directly.&#10;4. Simplified deployment: The sidecar architecture can make deployment and scaling in a Kubernetes environment more straightforward.&#10;&#10;While it may not have all the advanced features of Flink, this project serves as an excellent PoC for building cloud-native stream processing systems with a focus on simplicity and Kubernetes integration." />

Traffic management: We'd use Istio's VirtualService and DestinationRule resources to control traffic flow between our components, potentially load balancing requests across multiple instances of our processing engine.&#10;&#10;3. Security: We'd leverage Istio's mutual TLS capabilities to secure communication between our services, enhancing the overall security posture of our data processing pipeline.&#10;&#10;4.
